## Project description

A simple maze-solving game where users can create their own room designs using text files, determining layout as well as the number of turns and amount of health.

## How to compile and run the program

Open the project in Apache NetBeans 12.0 and click the Run Project button.

## UI Design

Opening the game displays a main menu (see Fig 1) where the player can load in different maps or start playing right away. Gameplay (see Fig 2) is turn-based and the player inputs directions (W, A, S, and D for up, left, down, and right) to move the player (the "a" symbol) through the maze, trying to reach the exit (the "&" symbol) and avoid the hazards (the "X" symbols). Map files (see Fig 3) are simple text files.
